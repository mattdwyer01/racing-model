"""
tab_results_poller.py -- fast, provisional race results, track condition/
rail updates, and live fixed prices, from TAB's public API.

MUST RUN FROM A REAL AUSTRALIAN IP -- TAB geo-blocks and TLS-fingerprints
everything else, VPS/cloud included in general (confirmed against GitHub-
hosted runners specifically), though a Vultr AU datacenter instance has been
confirmed working in practice, contrary to the general rule. Runs today as a
GitHub Actions self-hosted runner (see .github/workflows/tab_results.yml)
registered from such a machine -- not a step on a normal hosted runner.

WHY THIS EXISTS
toprate.au (the authoritative results feed used by update_results() in
toprate_daily.py) does not resolve a race's result until its WHOLE MEETING
has finished -- see toprate_price_refresh.py's module docstring. On an 8-race
meeting, race 1's result can sit unresolved on the dashboard for hours after
it's actually run. TAB exposes each race's result the moment that race goes
Interim/Paying, independent of the rest of the meeting. This script closes
that gap for the one thing TAB is good at -- who won, by how much, in what
order -- and changes NOTHING else. It never touches `resulted`, `wpr_actual`,
or comments_video/comments_steward: those stay exclusively the authoritative
feed's job, so update_results() keeps re-checking and finalizing exactly as
it does today, including correcting anything TAB got wrong (e.g. a protest).

WHAT IT WRITES (toprate_runners.csv, via toprate_daily.load_runners/save_runners)
    finish_position, won, placed, interim_resulted (per runner, from race
    results -- interim_resulted flips the dashboard's race-level "done"
    display flag right away, see apply_results())
    going, track_grading, rail_position (per meeting, from trackCondition/
    railPosition -- applied to every runner at that venue+date, since
    conditions are a whole-card property, not a per-race one). A real going
    change also triggers a WPR ratings recompute, scoped to just that
    meeting (see run_once()/compute_wpr_projection's target_venues param).
    fixed_win_price, scratched (per runner, from a race's own fixedOdds --
    see fetch_today_results' `prices` docstring and apply_prices()). A
    SECOND, independent source alongside toprate_price_refresh.py's
    existing 5-min refresh, not a replacement of it.
WHAT IT NEVER TOUCHES
    resulted, wpr_actual, comments_video, comments_steward, race_id, run_id,
    or any WPR/rating column except via the scoped recompute above. A later
    authoritative fetch overwrites the result fields anyway once the
    meeting resolves, so a wrong or partial TAB read there is
    self-correcting, never a lasting bad state.

MATCHING
toprate_runners.csv keys results by the provider's own run_id/race_id, which
TAB knows nothing about. So rows are matched on (date, venue, race, tab_number)
instead, case-insensitively -- TAB returns AU venue names in ALL CAPS
("GRAFTON", "TATURA") while the provider CSV uses Title Case ("Grafton"),
confirmed against a real payload. TAB's venue names also frequently don't
match the provider's beyond casing (provider says "Belmont Park", TAB says
"BELMONT"; provider says "Sandown", TAB splits it into "SANDOWN-HILLSIDE" and
"SANDOWN-LAKESIDE") -- see VENUE_ALIASES below (keys upper-cased). An
unmatched TAB venue is logged loudly and skipped, never guessed at.

FETCHING
Confirmed against a real payload: the meeting-list response already embeds
each race's raceStatus and finishing results[] directly on its stub, before
any drill-down, plus enough on the meeting object (venueMnemonic) and race
stub (hasFixedOdds, raceStartTime) to decide what's worth fetching further.
Results/conditions read straight off this cheap tier: one request per AU
state per cycle, no drill-down needed at all.

Prices are the one thing that genuinely isn't on the cheap tier (confirmed
via --probe-odds from an AU IP: starting_price_sp and fixedOdds both only
exist at the race-detail level). Rather than following a meeting's
_links.races hop first, the race-detail URL is built directly from
venue_mnemonic + race number (RACE_DETAIL), one extra request per race that
is both still open (hasFixedOdds True, not yet Paying/Abandoned) and
starting within PRICE_LOOKAHEAD_HOURS (same bounding window
toprate_price_refresh.py already uses) -- not every open race on the card
all day. That detail response's runners[] carries a fixedOdds dict per
runner (returnWin/returnPlace/bettingStatus/flucs/...).

USAGE
    pip install curl_cffi
    python tab_results_poller.py --diagnose      # check AU IP + TLS shim first
    python tab_results_poller.py                 # run the live polling loop
    python tab_results_poller.py --once           # single pass (workflow/cron)

Scheduling in production: an external cron-job.org schedule calls
.github/workflows/tab_results.yml's workflow_dispatch endpoint during AU
racing hours, which dispatches to the self-hosted runner, which runs
`--once --no-push` (the workflow's own step handles git).

PUBLISHING (patch_data_json vs. a full rebuild)
A plain results/prices/scratches cycle no longer runs the full
`toprate_daily.py --rebuild-only` subprocess (~2-3 min on a modest 1
vCPU/2GB box, dominated by a form-history/settling-band rebuild that
doesn't depend on any of these fields at all) - it patches just the
touched runners' fx/f/won/scr keys directly into the existing
toprate_data.json (see toprate_daily.patch_data_json()), which is a
fraction of a second. Only a real going change still forces the full
rebuild, since that's what the scoped WPR recompute needs to get its
wprp_* fields serialized. A typical cycle should now complete in well
under a minute; the workflow's concurrency group (skips an overlapping
trigger rather than queuing it) still guards against a genuinely slow
cycle (a real going change, or patch_data_json falling back to a full
rebuild) overlapping the next trigger.

    (confirmed against a real payload). Returns (updated_df, n_written,
    unmatched_venues).

    Also sets interim_resulted = 1 on every row written -- this is what
    flips the dashboard's race-level "done" flag (see toprate_daily.py's
    RACES payload build) as soon as TAB reports a finishing position, well
    before update_results() gets to that meeting and sets the real
    `resulted`. Never touches resulted/wpr_actual/comments_* -- see module
    docstring.

    Also returns `patches`: run_id -> {"f": finish, "won": won} for every
    row written, keyed the same way toprate_data.json's own runner records
    are ("rid") -- lets run_once() patch the JSON directly instead of
    running the full rebuild for a plain results cycle. Only rows with a
    non-blank run_id are included (a runner not yet through a full rebuild
    has no "rid" match in the JSON yet - patching it would be a no-op
    anyway, and its result is safely picked up on the next full rebuild).

    in this list, every OTHER runner (not one of the reported top 4) gets
    won=0/placed=0/interim_resulted=1 -- but finish_position is deliberately
    left alone (we only know it's outside the top 4, not the exact
    placing). Safe to reuse won=0 for this: an unresulted runner's `won` is
    always NaN, never 0 (confirmed against a real payload), so this can't
    be confused with "not yet resulted". Never overwrites a row that
    already has a finish_position (an exact known placing always wins over

    #      Trackers/Summary tab until the next slot, sometimes hours later
    #      (real user report, Coco Dior, 2026-09-17). Fixed first by only
    #      running this when n_result_rows > 0.
    #   2. CAPTURE lag - a runner that only becomes newly solo-qualifying
    #      partway through the day (e.g. a rival's own WPR gap drifts past
    #      GAP_MAX as projections refine, same mechanism as the Albert
    #      Palais/Hozumi case worked through 2026-09-17) can have its whole
    #      qualifying window open and close between two daily.yml slots,
    #      permanently missing the durable CSV log even though the live
    #      Race tab already shows it via lib/trackerRules.ts's
    #      liveTrackerCandidates(). Fixed by running this on every cycle
    #      that did ANY work (results/conditions/prices/scratches), not
    #      just a result-writing one - real user feedback (2026-09-17,
    #      "then the tracker should be updated" - capture more often was
    #      the confirmed intent, not re-evaluating an already-logged pick).
    # toprate_data.json is ~85MB, so this is a real, deliberate per-cycle
    # cost, not free - accepted because a plain price cycle already reads/
    # writes that same file once via patch_data_json_safe() above, and the
    # self-hosted runner has room under tab_results.yml's 15-min timeout.
    # A genuinely no-op cycle (nothing at all changed) already returned
    # above, before this point, so this doesn't run on those.
    # Read-only against toprate_data.json/toprate_runners.csv, writes only
    # its own two tracker CSVs (see its own module docstring) - best-effort,
    # like compute_wpr_projection() above, so a bug in it never takes down
